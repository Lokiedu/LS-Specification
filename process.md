# Project infrastructure

Work on LibertySoil.org is team-centric \(not project-centric\). LokiEducation team at this point is the only team we have, but we anticipate other teams forming in the future.

LokiEducation projects infrastructure guidelines:

1\) Developers work in GitHub Issues. Any task that has code as it's output should be in GitHub. We use two way Asana &lt;&gt; GitHub sync, but our guideline here is that only code-resulting tasks should be in GitHub. All non-code tasks should be kept in Google Calendar or Asana.

2\) Managers, researchers, UX people - work in Asana. Asana is connected to GitHub selectively. Most projects aren't synced back to Github. You can also access asana tasks in Instagantt.

3\) Time blocks are scheduled in Google Calendar. Those are generic and are made to:

3.1\) Verify work time availability - make sure team member is available.

3.2\) Submit daily work reports - those go into event Description field.

4\) Each project has to be as small as possible. No "Someday-Maybe" tasks. At best we accept "Backlog" tasks with someday-maybe content. Our default place for drafts - this wiki. Each project has a wiki page and wiki page accumulates all stuff future: roadmap, plans, drafts, sketches, suggestions.

5\) Google calendar rules them all.
