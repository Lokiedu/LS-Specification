# Main navigation

Left (in the ltr) sidebar specification. Facebook-like, it will have a number of small innovations across it to improve user experience and content discovery. 

## Design 
 
{% method %} 

Current menu - one of the most annoying parts of the site. It's behavior is erratic - especially when it sticks to the left edge of the screen.

{% sample lang="planned" -%}
{% sample lang="live" -%}
{% sample lang="ice" -%}
{% common -%}
* [ ] Okay
{% endmethod %}
{% method %} 

## Experience 

We aim to make left menu always changing, interactive area that serves user commands that he might get interested at. Commands at the very top are rather static, towards the bottom edge of the screen get more random and fast-changing.

{% sample lang="planned" -%}

### Collapse - expand

Navigation is responsible. We start with just 2 sizes responsive support that will work for "collapse" and "expand" states.

{% sample lang="live" -%}

### Collapse - expand


{% sample lang="ice" -%}

 [ ] Deliberate (user-initiated) collapse/expand (this tiny long thing near the globe icon - it's height signifies what size is currently on.

[ ] Animation for collapse-expand effect has to be well defined and worked through. 
* [ ] Logic of smart text titles / links (see XL Size and "4 new posts")
* [ ] Animation in extra large titles (could be marque)
* [ ] Specifications for color schemes in [Colors](/colors.md)
* [ ] "Small" version of left sidebar navigation has to open on small screens (tablets and smaller) by default. This needs to be described and well tested.
* [ ] Possible switch to san francisco display font.
* [ ] Possible custom icons (user set/suggested)
* [ ] Notification-in-menu (numbers of unread items in each menu item (see "4" next to News Feed)
